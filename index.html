                <p>To rebuild my programming skills, remind myself of some coding and catch up to the current emerging trends.
                    In the current world, so much is changing so fast sparked by new technologies but programming remains ever relevant
                    with only new languages coming up.  
                    It is also a requirement at work to learn a new skill, sparking my interest in rekindling programming skills.
